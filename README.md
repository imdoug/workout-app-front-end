# 💪 Workout Tracker DevMuscles


### 📖 About this app 
On this app you can submit all your workout routines with the number of reps and also the weight your lifting so you can  brag with all your friends. you can submit your workout exercices so you have that as your routine, and when you get bored and want to spicy things a little bit, you can update the workouts changing the weight or the number of repetitions or even the exercise itself. To make things even more personal, you have a profile available to you where you can add a profile picture, your height, your weight so you can keep track if your losing or gaining weight depending on your goal.
